# Developer documentation

Notes:

`CENTER` for center

0,0 is left down

Language tags are first looking up main tag, if matching, use it, otherwise find sumtag, and if still not present, use `en`.

Locales: First ISO-639 language specifier (such as "en" for English, "de" for German, etc). Then country strings in the format YY, where "YY" is an ISO-3166 country code

Just use `git diff` to get the changes

From discord:

It's generally recommended to const-ref objects of which size extends 2 * sizeof(std::uintmax_t) aka 16 bytes
